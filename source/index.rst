Betina - general rants
======================

This is a collection of thoughts and ramblings related to software, hardware and DIY project development.
In other words, random comments and thoughts I've collected over the years.

Well ... not really years, as I only started writing (and collecting) these recently.

.. warning::
    The contents are highly opinionated and contain various ironic, hyperbolic and mocking statements.
    Part of the text should be taken seriously, while the other parts shall not.
    The classification of each may vary over time.


Objective and Incentive
-----------------------

This thought collection is a product of documenting the thoughts and ideas sprung from discussions with friends and colleagues.
My incentive is pretty clear: expose and detail the controversial thoughts.

Like this one:

    I try to make things "me-proof".
    I strive to make thing simple, not because I think of myself as a smart person, but for the exact opposite.
    I attempt to document and explain in a clear manner for the next guy, for it is very likely that the next guy is future me.
