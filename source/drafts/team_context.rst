Team Context
============

Someone else's knowledge and context ("multiple context tracking").
At the start, when working individually, our recorded work/dev history matches the "thing" identically.
After all, it is in its whole our creation.
The way that we recall events, by names and milestones, we tend to transfer that method into the "thing's" history.

In the moment that one starts to work in a tem/group, and is required to collaborate, a "choice" needs to be made: either the history is shared among all members, or or the thing is considered an entity on its own.

The first usually is the default in a small or unexperienced team.
