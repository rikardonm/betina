Take the Plunge
===============

| Let go.
| Take the plunge.
| Go on.
| Do it.
| Although hurtful,
| Sometimes raising the white flag
| is the right thing to be done.
|
| The missing incentive,
| That last evidence,
| Is sometimes found in the least expected place.
|
| It may even knock at your door and say hello.
| It is up to you to listen.
|
| The most important messages is never said.
| It is felt.
