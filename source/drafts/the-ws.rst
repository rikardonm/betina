The Ws
======

In various ways, I've come to believe that the basic W questions are the fundamental questions that are the basis for all others.

They are:

    - Why
    - When
    - Where
    - Who
    - How

Although I'm very fond of `why` specifically, I see the importance and weight of the others.
After all, they each account for a differnt "domain" of sorts.
