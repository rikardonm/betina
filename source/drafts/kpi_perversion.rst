The perversion of KPIs
======================

Just like the central bank, we're susceptible for the perversion of our evaluation metrics.


The Pitfall
-----------





The Duality
-----------

It is unfair, unproductive and unhealthy to work towards no clear goal.
It is a road to nowhere.
On that road, you never arrive, because you are already there.


Personal Resolution
-------------------

Tell me what is important and what I'd be judged on.

Don't tell me how.


Examples
--------

* Central banks and inflation + interest rates
* Politicians and indexes
* Adjusting request dates to reduce measured cycle times (shipping)
