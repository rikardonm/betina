Agile - Fundamentals
====================

breakdown of agile and its interaction with work items

how to
break up work tasks
track work done
estimate work load
distribute work items
delegate roles



claim: hardware development is the same as software development.

(A) partition work & period cycle
"Produce running, tested, working, integrated software every two weeks, every week.
Build your skills until you can create a new fully operational version every day, twice a day, multiple times a day."

the work must be partitionable
the partitions must be able to be independently specified & characterized
the partitions specifications must be able to be validated independently
the partitions can be deemed complete independently
the average partition work cycle period is defined by the partion's average completion time
declare and complete a partition on each partition work cycle period (1 day)
e.g. design requirements for power supply;
simulate and validate power supply circuit;
make schematic for power supply;

(B) parallel-objective work
"Keep the design of that software clean.
As it grows, the design will tend to become complex and crufty.
Resist and reverse this tendency consciously, refactoring in tiny continuous steps, all the time, so that your rate of progress is as steady and consistent as possible."

the partitions must be able to be sequenced (one after next)
the partitions must be executed in the planned order (optimally)
improvement work that can be partitioned in fractions shall be added to the work sequence
larger re-organization work must be translated into default work

(A) think and plan before acting act only (mostly) based on the plan
integrate improvements in the partitionable work

(C)

"Use the current increment of software as the foundation for all your conversations with your product leadership and management.
Speak in terms of what's ready to go, and in terms of what they'd like you to do next."
default work
(A) must be requested by PO and PM PO and PM do not partition default work



--- it naturally develops,
when the need to have a more detailed look into the tasks arises
when the need to develop a more accurate time estimation for the job
