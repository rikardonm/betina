The Core of Computing
=====================

Events and states are two sides of the same coin:
    on one we have `John F. Kennedy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_dollar_(United_States_coin)>`,
    in the other `Curtis James Jackson III <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent>`.


Although they can be considered dual, they are actually complementary.

All programs can be reduced to the following statements:

- A system reacts to events
- States gate events
- Events change states

And here we can see the "feedback loop"-like effect that one has on the other.
They are, by nature, intertwined.
