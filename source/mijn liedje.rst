Mijn Liedje
===========

|
| What once was, will never again be
| Memories eternal in light
| Eternal in me.
|
| As we come up to dawn
| I cling onto you
| Something so simple
| Yet so true.
|
| These days are no fun,
| They end up being lived one by one,
| No joy, no smile,
| Not really happy for a while.
|
| It pains me in my heart,
| Imagining all the time I could have had you not so far.
| It stings like stake,
| But it leaves no visible scar.
|
| I stride,
| Still trying to find,
| With tears in my eyes,
| Something that I lost,
| Very far behind.
|
| Hope wanes away slowly,
| And while I say "someday, maybe"
| Noting really changes,
| Wishing it was
| Someday baby.
|
| Now it's time to say goodbye, sweetie,
| One more time.
| I'll carry you forever, here,
| In my mind.
