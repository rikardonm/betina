Harsh Evaluation
================

Shallow comments and arguments are proof of ignorance.

Given that, it is almost certain (and safe to assert) that the speaker is not well informed.

The speaker thereby shows lack of knowledge of the topic, or at least interest in getting educated on it.

Furthermore, when they are accompanied by the "authoritative appeal", this means that either:

#. You are saying rubbish
#. The speaker doesn't have any other arguments, or better arguments, doesn't understand your point and perhaps didn't even try

The speaker may be tired or feel personally attacked, have been put on a corner or in the spotlight.

Another evidence of such is the unconscious inference of the whole by an example, by the speaker.
That is, the speaker derives a concept of a tool, use, etc. from an example (that happens to be bad or incorrect).

The speaker then takes this as "the" use, without investigation h
