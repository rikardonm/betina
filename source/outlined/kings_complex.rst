The King's Complex
==================

Fore-something
--------------

We all have worked (or currently are) with colleagues that have what I call "the king's complex".
I have no idea if such behavior has already been documented, explored or detailed.
I have done zero research on it.
Just like most things, one observes, one thinks, one talks and one writes.

Before I go on and explain what that means, a proper disclaimer is due.
I, myself, for that matter, have been a king.
I was once such a colleague.
As my perception of the observed subjects, I had no malice or ill-intent in my actions.

    The road to hell is full of good intentions.

And so was I.


Behavior
--------

Let's take an example to describe the behavior, colleague X.
Colleague X is very smart, does their job well and is very smart.
Colleague X is always looking for improvements and has great ideas.

The ideas are usually shared in meetings, with the leading "I agree with you, we should do ``<WHATEVER>``".
Then a week goes by, and nobody did ``<WHATEVER>``.
You didn't do anything.
Colleague X didn't do anything.

Then two weeks go by.
The same improvement idea comes back up.
Another week goes by, and nothing changed.
And wouldn't you know, the story repeats itself again.

The problem is all talk and no action.


Definition
----------

The King's Complex is the behavior of observing, detecting and informing changes that, when taken collevtively by the group, would result in improvements.
The suggested changes vary in depth and impact, but mostly require little effort or have little impact on the speaker.


Cause, Environment and Culture
------------------------------



Plot-Twist
----------

The more I think and the more I write, I come to believe that this cannot be "blamed" *per se*  on a specific individual.
