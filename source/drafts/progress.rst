Progress & Changes
==================

What are the changes that we need to make to improve?
Wel, usually, it is the undesirable and not common (to us) path that we need to take, for "if we'd like those options we'd already taken 'em".

Now, it is important to make the distinction between disliking something (component, approach, idea) than having arguments against it.

So, sometimes, the results and gains are behind our fears and beyond our current reality.
