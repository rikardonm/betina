interfaces, abstractions: they are all the same

one requires the other.

--> models
what can you do with it
and how do you do it?






SW fear or disgust

rootsL?

lack of knowledge or control -> fear and uncertainty, anxiousness


the roles of autonomy, authority and agency
what is the relation between them?








fuckos -> board generation based on python types



modelling of micro??




-- on the mentality of not making mistakes (errors)
when can you do them?
when can you not?
what is important, what is not?










on the final objective as (being) paramount

although the statement is true, one's blind focus on it can actually impair one's ability to complete a task.
one focuses on getting the answer, getting work done, that one easily ignores the work at hand.
one expects and hopes that the current work shall be easy and quick.
when faced with a different reality, the one where things are difficult, arduous and complex, one becomes anxious and irritated.
hopes turn into broken expectations, and the will to progress turns into frustration.








Programming, documentation and regexes

Handling state
--------------

Handling state, I may say, is one of the most difficult tasks in programming.
For, you don't just hold it, you do something with it.
And therein the problem lies: doing something with it.
What do you do?
When do you do it?
How many of you do it?


Variables, state machines, behavior trees: how do they relate to one another?

Variables store a uni-dimensional, momentary and individual value.
They, indeed, represent a single concept whose value may mutate across time.

State machines define how these values mutate, based on the environment (inputs) of the system.

Behavior trees... do basically the same thing?

Maybe BTs are for FSMs as the imperative paradigm is to object oriented.

BTs are imperative, they declare orders.
FSMs are live "things", they breathe.... right?
