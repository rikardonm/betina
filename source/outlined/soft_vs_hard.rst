Software vs. Hardware
=====================

I pose the following propsition: hardware development is very, **very** similar to software development.

They share the same "project development" principles, and some ways, share the same outcome requirements.

These are:
    * Requirement to have artifact versions
    * Requirement to have validation tests
    * Nature of incremental improvement
    * Nature of being inherently being able to broken up
    * Benefits of collaboration, including reviews
    * Multiple domains of knowledge (languages, systems, software, processes)
    * Usage of libraries: common and validated blocks upon which things are built
