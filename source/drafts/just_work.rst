"Just Work"
===========

The never-ending desire of making things simple, with a "just work" mentality led to the development of Arduino.
This very successful project makes complex, up until this point, electronic design projects reachable for the wider audience.

It, however, does not get the same praise from the "highly educated" and "expert" technical community.
It is seen as a toy, and no real product will or would be developed on it.

Well, they are short-sighted, in so far as they now seek to have the same user experience and results.
Hypocrisy, where they want to replicate the flaws they earlier pointed out.

Furthermore, they curtail a detailed analysis of these uses.
The result is a poorly developed product, where it looks awesome and works wonderfully, as long as oyou don't stray away from the given examples.
The system is not modular.
