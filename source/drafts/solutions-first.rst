Solutions First
===============

Foreword
--------

Just like Mike Rowe advocates Safety First, I advocate for Solution First problem approach.

Fuck all of these processes that require documentation and lengthy explanation about the issue.
Fuck all of these nonsensical 8 steps to solve something that I can solve in less than 5 minutes with a hammer.
Fuck all of these people that try to constrain my workflow.

They know nothing about solving things effectively and getting to the result.
I know how to solve problems, I am good at it.
I will show how I can solve it faster and better.


Aftword
-------

And as it turns out, things are not what meets the eye.

.. epigraph::

    If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense.
    Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn’t. 
    And contrary wise, what is, it wouldn’t be. 
    And what it wouldn’t be, it would. You see?

    -- Hatter, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

Unfortunately I, truly, believe that progress is not immediate and does not come from the straightes path.
If at all, the straightest path is a shortcut.
And for every shortcut taken, a compromise was made.

You could start a debate wether a comprise is made in any decision (always), but I'll leave it to another time.


Piledrivers
-----------

What motivated this rant was the observation that there are of two types of people.
When confronted with a problem there are those who find a solution and there are those who find a cause.

I've seen this over and over again to the extend that I now think it may be a "core shaper" of one's personality.


Solutions
+++++++++

People who find a solution usually tend to be more practical, immediate and, to some extend, emotional.

Everynow and again I remember a famous GIF.... this one:

.. image:: train-tunnel.gif

It illustrates exactly my though: why the hell are you brute forcing a solution?
It probably won't work for all cases, so it's not effective.
You most certainly won't know what actually fixed the problem, because you've thrown about 5 different things at it, at the same time.


Causes
++++++


Disclaimer
----------

Yes, I've put this all the way to the end.
It seemed to make more sense.
Anyway, the disclaimer is that I think I fit in the category of people who find the causes first, solutions later.


Why, why, why
-------------

And you may ask, `why, why, why` should I bother or should I care?
It is pretty simple: I truly believe that by finding the causes first is more efficient, as the solution will be 

Since there is uncertainty in what exactly fixed the problem, whatever is being worked on now becomes a castle of cards:
don't touch or change it, else it may stop working and we don't know why or how to fix it differently.


Syntoms
-------

"Doctor, do I have it?" you may ask.
Take the following quiz and find out.

1. Do you "jump straight in" or do you feel the waters first?
2. Does "If it is working, it is good enough." seem like a reasonable statement?
