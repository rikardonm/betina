A Little Raven
==============

| There was once a little raven.
| He lived off the forest.
| Eat a bug here, eat an ant there,
| The little raven didn't plan ahead.
|
| He lived happily in the spring,
| When the sun shines and the rain provides.
| Life is beautiful, life is free,
| Life from tree to tree.
|
| The little raven never thought about tomorrow.
| I can handle it all.
| Today it works great.
| Tomorrow should follow.
|
| I take pride in my fast response,
| They all seem to like my support.
| Always on a call,
| Always breaking a fall.
|
| But the little raven didn't know
| That even his tall clout
| Could not save him
| From hitting the wall.
|
| There was one day
| That the Little Raven that could,
| Simply could no more.
| A new solution for what worked yesterday
| Has now came simply
| A little too late.
|
| Money can buy a lot of things.
| Houses, cars, drugs and bling.
| The Little Raven got frustrated
| Angry and right out mad,
| When he realized
| He had screwed up bad.
|
| The Little Raven only didn't know
| That he could no longer buy time
| As he had done once before.
