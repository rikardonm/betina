types of bugs

every system has bugs, no one can run away from it, be it NSA, NASA or even Google.

however, bugs can provide valuable insight.

more specifically, what caught my attention is that the type of bug can provide information related to the maturity of the developers.

kinds of bugs:

* language mishandling - undefined behavior
* system mishandling
** error recovery
** undefined system behavior
** corner cases
* interoperability between components
** API changes
** underlying behavior change
