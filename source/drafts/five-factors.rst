The Five Factors
================

Life made me think long and hard about how people go along theirs.
That, it is not only I that have struggles.
It is not only I that have problems, issues or things to solve.

I found to be almost universal that we, humans, have some sort of struggle.
But, having "something" is not the qualification, but rather how much one feels impacted by such.
One could even say how much one feels tormented by these factors.

Up to this moment I have collected 5 factors:

#. Economic
#. Physical
#. Mental
#. Social
#. Family


1 - Economic
------------

The person doesn't have any money.
They're broke, and they don't seem to be in a path where the situation will change.
They are unable to participate in social events, frequently overspend and even perhaps live with borrowed money.


2 - Physical
------------

The person has some sort of limitation, disease or special necessity.
Like in a stupid example: the person doesn't have a leg.


3 - Mental
----------

The person has some missing screws in the head, isn't really straight.
That can be: depression, disorders, emotional instability or PTSD.


4 - Social
----------

The person has a scarred social past, by their making or not.
Examples are: former sex worker (where it is not culturally accepted), publicly shaming (like leaked nudes), former inmate and so on.


5 - Family
----------

The person has a "problematic" family member.
These can be a partner (wife/husband), children and so forth.


Notes
-----

It is worthy to note that none of these factors sway forward or against the goodness of a person.
A person can be holy, but still fall onto one of the classifications.
A person may be evil and fall in none.
