On Knowledge vs. Content
------------------------

Coding (programming) is only advantageous and profitable, in the long term, when an entity (user, company) has both knowledge and content.

In the case where only knowledge is present, there is indeed potential.
But potential does not exert any change in the physical universe around its actor.
Knowledge gives the entity the power of understanding what is presented to it, and thus enabling it to make decisions with more information than otherwise it would.

In the case where only content is present, there are indeed results.
But results are, well, the end of the chain.
They are, by nature, the result of a process.
If the process does not change, the expected results will also not change.
Content gives the entity the means to interact with its surrounding universe, and thus enabling it to shape the world it is situated in.


-- Also idea vs. prototype


In the case where only content exists, a very good example is Linux (and Unix OSs).
Linux is open source, free of license and widely distributed.
However, it is no good if who gets access to it doesn't know about it, unable to build, deploy or modify at will.

In the case where only knowledge exists, an example is .... XX??
