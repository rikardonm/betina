My Lines
========


#. Take responsibility. Decide.
#. "This is a development environment where only the paranoid can survive;"
#. "If I could have a wish I'd sure wish that I had never grown up"
#. Take action and its responsibilities.
#. Fuck this shit.
#. Actions that don't depend solely of your time have higher priorities.
#. Don't wait to ask for favors.
#. It's time to clean this thing already.
#. Do not eat your meat where you harvest your wheat.
#. Stop imagining things that won't happen. Hope is futile without action.
#. I know you want to, I know you probably need to, but we must leave.
#. You cannot do that now. Don't think about it.
#. "Stop cussing"
#. Never again let yourself say "if had done it first"
#. Leave, and never come back.
#. The only way to increase efficiency is to reduce waste.
#. People are more concerned in being right than in being true.
#. if nothing else is achieved, you've learnt what no to do.
#. what makes me sad is not what i've done wrong. it's what i didn't do. it's what i could not do.
#. get your groove on. do not let yourself cripple down.
#. don't be a try hard.
#. we are always trying to impress someone. we all want to be recognized.
#. you build a castle, but you build it out of sand. someday comes the tide and makes you do it all over again.
#. my likes? one more: black high thighs
#. FUCK IT.


It's only too bad that I don't have the original date, but it likely got the current format around 2014.
